## Devices

I was previously running Supervisor (HASSIO) with the [Synology native Package](https://community.home-assistant.io/t/hass-io-on-synology-dsm-native-package/125559)
Prior to that I was running HASSIO as a Virtual Machine on my Synology DS918+ this replaced an older Docker Version running on a DS1511+ Synology.

Now I am running Home Assistant Core on Unraid.

### Security

I have replaced the Synology Surveillance Station with [Frigate](https://github.com/blakeblackshear/frigate) this is using a [Google Coral](https://coral.ai/products/accelerator) USB stick for object based motion detection. Person, Car (Automobile), Cat's, Dog's etc
I plan on running [DeepStack](https://docs.deepstack.cc/) On a [Nvidia Jetson Nano 4GB Dev Kit](https://www.nvidia.com/en-gb/autonomous-machines/embedded-systems/jetson-nano/) for Face Recognition based on motion events provided by [Frigate](https://github.com/blakeblackshear/frigate).
